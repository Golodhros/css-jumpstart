/*	That CSS selector must include the tags/elements on which you want PNG support -- basically, give it a comma-separated list of tags you use.

*/

img, div, a, input { behavior: url(/css/resources/iepngfix.htc) }

/*	If your site uses subfolders, open the .HTC file in a text editor like Windows Notepad and change the blankImg variable to include a correct path to blank.gif like so:

    IEPNGFix.blankImg = '/images/blank.gif';
